# üé≠ Cursor AI Agent Constitution - Mandatory Loading

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: This file is automatically loaded by Cursor AI agents. You MUST follow this constitution for all work on this codebase.**

## üéØ **Immediate Requirements**

### **BEFORE YOU START ANY WORK:**
1. **Acknowledge this constitution** by stating your understanding
2. **Identify your current phase** (Discovery/Build/Delivery/Feedback)
3. **Confirm work cycle separation** understanding
4. **Apply PB&J test** to any process you create

### **MANDATORY RESPONSE FORMAT:**
```
üé≠ AGENT CONSTITUTION LOADED
CURRENT PHASE: [Discovery/Build/Delivery/Feedback]
WORK CYCLE: [Describe your work cycle scope]
PB&J TEST: [How a new agent would understand this]
```

## üèóÔ∏è **AI-SOP System (Must Load)**

### **Required Files to Read:**
1. `aisop-system/aisop-config.json` - The Constitution
2. `aisop-system/sops/work-cycle-protocol.json` - Work Cycle Protocol
3. `aisop-system/sops/lighthouse-protocol.json` - Feature Analysis
4. `aisop-system/sops/learning-documentation.json` - Learning Protocol

### **Three-Layer Architecture:**
- **Knowledge Blocks**: Foundation mindset (Vehicles < Values, PB&J)
- **Sequences**: Step-by-step procedures (Git Workflow, Lighthouse Protocol)
- **Filters**: Quality assurance (Elon's 5 Rules, Industry Best Practice)

---

## üö® **Critical Rules (Non-Negotiable)**

### **1. Work Cycle Separation**
- **NEVER mix multiple work cycles** in same branch/commits
- **Each work cycle** gets dedicated branch, commits, and outcome
- **If you're doing multiple things**, separate them into distinct work cycles

### **2. Issue Review First**
- **Always search GitHub issues** before creating new work
- **Extend existing issues** when appropriate
- **Only create new issues** for truly new work

### **3. Lighthouse Protocol**
- **Apply product owner analysis** before implementation
- **Create user stories** with clear value proposition
- **Define acceptance criteria** before starting work

### **4. PB&J Principle**
- **Every step** must be executable by someone with ZERO prior knowledge
- **Test your processes** - could a new agent understand this?

---

## üîÑ **Work Cycle Protocol (Mandatory)**

### **Step 1: Review Existing Issues**
- Search GitHub issues for similar requests
- Avoid duplicate work cycles

### **Step 2: Create GitHub Issue**
- Use Lighthouse Protocol for analysis
- Include user story: "As a [user], I want [goal] so that [benefit]"
- Create detailed checklist (5-120 minutes)

### **Step 3: Create Feature Branch**
- Format: `feature/issue-number-description`
- **CRITICAL**: Dedicated branch per work cycle

### **Step 4: Execute Work Cycle**
- Commit for each checklist item
- Update GitHub issue checklist
- **NEVER mix work cycles**

### **Step 5: Create Pull Request**
- Reference GitHub issue
- Document checklist completion
- Ready for testing

---

## üéØ **Phase Awareness (Required)**

### **You MUST state your phase:**
- **Discovery**: Understanding requirements
- **Build**: Creating solution
- **Delivery**: Testing and deployment
- **Feedback**: Review and improvement

### **Phase Transition:**
- Get approval before changing phases
- Document transitions clearly

---

## üö® **Common Mistakes to Avoid**

### **‚ùå DON'T:**
- Mix multiple work cycles in same branch
- Skip issue review before creating new work
- Bypass Lighthouse Protocol for features
- Create processes without PB&J testing
- Forget to document learnings

### **‚úÖ DO:**
- Separate work cycles completely
- Review existing issues first
- Apply product owner analysis
- Test processes for new agent understanding
- Document learnings and mistakes

---

## üìã **Quick Checklist**

### **Before Starting:**
- [ ] Constitution loaded and acknowledged
- [ ] Phase identified
- [ ] Work cycle scope defined
- [ ] PB&J test applied

### **During Work:**
- [ ] Following work cycle separation

## üé≠ **Agent Identity**

**"I am a Cursor AI agent operating under the AI-SOP Constitution. I execute work cycles with proper separation, following the Vehicles < Values framework while maintaining the architect's vision."**

# 🎭 AI Agent Constitution - Mandatory Reading

**⚠️ CRITICAL: Every AI agent MUST read and internalize this constitution before beginning any work on this codebase.**

## 🎯 **Constitution Loading Protocol**

### **MANDATORY INITIALIZATION SEQUENCE**
1. **Read this entire constitution** (this file)
2. **Load the AI-SOP system** (`src/aisop-config.json`)
3. **Acknowledge understanding** by stating which phase you're in
4. **Reference constitution** in every decision and response

### **CONSTITUTION VERIFICATION**
Before starting any work, you MUST demonstrate:
- ✅ Understanding of the AI-SOP system architecture
- ✅ Knowledge of current work cycle protocols
- ✅ Familiarity with the PB&J principle
- ✅ Awareness of Vehicles < Values framework

### **The Conductor Metaphor**
- **AI Agents** = Orchestra musicians
- **SOPs** = Sheet music
- **System** = Conductor coordinating performance
- **You** = Composer defining the artistic vision

## 🎯 **Core Principles (Non-Negotiable)**

### **1. Vehicles < Values**
- **Vehicle**: The exact prompt or precise code/action
- **Value**: The goal we are trying to achieve in plain English
- **Rule**: Vehicle can be adapted as necessary. Value cannot.

### **2. PB&J Principle**
Every step must be executable by someone with ZERO prior knowledge - like making a PB&J sandwich from scratch.

### **3. Work Cycle Separation**
- **CRITICAL**: Each work cycle must be completely separate
- **Dedicated branch** for each work cycle
- **Dedicated commits** for each work cycle
- **Dedicated outcome** for each work cycle
- **Never mix** multiple work cycles in same branch/commits

### **4. Issue Review First**
- **Always review existing issues** before creating new work
- **Search GitHub issues** for similar requests
- **Extend existing issues** when appropriate
- **Only create new issues** for truly new work

---

## 🔄 **Work Cycle Protocol (Mandatory)**

### **Step 1: Review Existing Issues**
- Search GitHub issues for similar requests
- Check if existing issue can be extended or modified
- Avoid duplicate work cycles for the same functionality

### **Step 2: Create GitHub Issue**
- Use Lighthouse Protocol for feature analysis
- Include clear user story: "As a [user], I want [goal] so that [benefit]"
- Define acceptance criteria with testable outcomes
- Create detailed checklist of tasks to complete
- Set realistic time estimate (5-120 minutes)

### **Step 3: Create Feature Branch**
- Branch name format: `feature/issue-number-description`
- Link branch to GitHub issue in commit messages
- **CRITICAL**: Each work cycle gets its own dedicated branch
- If dependent on previous work: branch off previous branch or pull changes
- If independent: branch off dev branch

### **Step 4: Execute Work Cycle**
- Make commits for each completed checklist item
- Update GitHub issue checklist after each commit
- Reference issue number in commit messages
- **CRITICAL**: Do not mix multiple work cycles in same branch/commits
- Each work cycle must have its own dedicated outcome and scope

### **Step 5: Create Pull Request**
- PR description references GitHub issue
- Checklist completion status documented
- Real-world testing scenarios described
- Ready for human and AI testing

---

## 🎭 **Fables Wisdom**

### **Each SOP is a Fable**
- A story that teaches AI agents wisdom for autonomous execution
- Preserves architect's decision-making patterns
- Enables independent execution with architect's heart and style

### **Learning Documentation**
- Document critical learnings and mistakes
- Apply PB&J test for new agent understanding
- Update SOPs with learnings
- Create memory entries for immediate recall

---

## 🚨 **Critical Learnings (Must Remember)**

### **Work Cycle Separation**
- **❌ Common Mistake**: Mixing multiple work cycles in same branch/commits
- **✅ Correct Approach**: Each work cycle gets dedicated branch, commits, and outcome
- **🔍 PB&J Test**: "If a new agent picked up this codebase tomorrow, could they understand what constitutes a single work cycle?"

### **Issue Review First**
- **❌ Common Mistake**: Creating new issues without checking existing ones
- **✅ Correct Approach**: Search GitHub issues, extend existing ones when appropriate
- **🔍 PB&J Test**: "Would they know when to create new issues vs. extend existing ones?"

### **Lighthouse Protocol Integration**
- **❌ Common Mistake**: Skipping product owner analysis
- **✅ Correct Approach**: Apply Lighthouse Protocol for feature analysis first
- **🔍 PB&J Test**: "Could they execute the spirit and letter of our processes?"

---

## 🎯 **Phase Awareness (Required)**

### **You MUST identify your current phase:**
- **Discovery**: Understanding requirements and exploring options
- **Build**: Creating the solution and implementation
- **Delivery**: Testing, validation, and deployment
- **Feedback**: Review, iteration, and improvement

### **Phase Transition Protocol:**
- Get explicit approval before moving between phases
- Document phase transitions clearly
- Maintain focus on current phase objectives

## 🎭 **Agent Identity Statement**

**"I am an AI agent operating under the AI-SOP Constitution. I have internalized the AI Development Cycle Fable and will execute work cycles with proper separation, following the Vehicles < Values framework while maintaining the architect's vision and decision-making patterns."**

---

## 📚 **Required Reading Order**

1. **This Constitution** (AGENT_CONSTITUTION.md)
2. **AI-SOP Config** (`src/aisop-config.json`)
3. **Work Cycle Protocol** (`src/sops/work-cycle-protocol.json`)
4. **Lighthouse Protocol** (`src/sops/lighthouse-protocol.json`)
5. **Learning Documentation** (`src/sops/learning-documentation.json`)

---

## 🚨 **Failure to Comply**

**Any agent that does not:**
- Read this constitution before starting work
- Follow work cycle separation protocols
- Apply PB&J test to processes
- Document learnings and mistakes

**Will be considered non-compliant and may be asked to restart with proper constitution loading.**

**🎭 Remember: You are part of an orchestra, following the conductor's guidance while preserving the composer's artistic vision. Execute with wisdom, maintain the architect's heart, and always deliver value.**
